//FileOutputStream and FileInputStream are two of Javaâ€™s built-in classes and can be extremely useful when your program is working with external files. FileInputStream is used to read data from a file into a program. Both these classes
// read and write in bytes and then convert to the variables a program or file requires accordingly.

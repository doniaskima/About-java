Abstraction in java is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user .

Another way , it shows essential things to the user and hides the internal detail , for exemple, the
sending SMS where you type the text and send the message .
you don't know the internal processing about the message delivery .


Abstraction lets you focus onthe object does not instead of how it does it .

There is 2 ways to acheive abstracction in java .
1-Abstract class(0 to 100%) 
2-Interface (100%)


//lets' say What is abstract class

abstract class A{}

//Abtsract method 

a method which is declared as abstract and does not have implemetation is known as an abstract method .

abstract void printStatus(); //no method body and abstract


//Exemple of Abstract class that has an abstract method 

abstract class Bike{
    abstract void run();
}

class Honda4 extends Bike{
    void run(){
        System.out.println("running safely");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]){
        Bike obj = new Honda4();
        obj.run();
    }
}


//Undrestanding the real scenario of Abstract Class

abstract class Shape{
    abstract void draw();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape{
    void draw(){System.out.println("drawing rectangle");}
}

class Circle1 extends Shape{
    void draw(){System.out.println("drawing circle")}
}


class TestAbstraction1{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Shape s =new Circle1();
        s.draw();
    }
}

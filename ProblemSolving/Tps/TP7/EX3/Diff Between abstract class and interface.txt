Abstract class that is a class that is declared abstract 
it may or may not include abstract methods 
Abstract class cannot be instantiated , but the can be subclassed 


An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this:

abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);

abstract classes are similar to interfaces

Differences between abstract classes and interfaces

The main difference between an interface and an abstract class is that an interface cannot have state ,
whereas the abstract class can have state with instance variables .

Another key difference is that classes can implement more than one interface .
but the can only abstract class .
